It was created to be easy to read and write while allowing for straightforward conversion to other formats, primarily HTML.

## For who ?

1. Bloggers and Writers: Many bloggers and writers use Markdown to draft and format blog posts, articles, and other web-based content. It offers a straightforward way to create well-structured articles that can be easily published on blogging platforms.
1. Documentation Writers: Technical writers and documentation teams frequently use Markdown to write user manuals, API documentation, and software guides. Markdown's simplicity is especially useful for creating technical documentation.
1. Academics and Researchers: Markdown is used by academics and researchers for writing research papers, lecture notes, and presentations. With the right tools, Markdown can be converted into LaTeX, which is commonly used in academia.
